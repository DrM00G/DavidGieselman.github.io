I will change this to a more impressive project soon, but this is all I can find the visuals for atm.

Now that 3D printing is infinitely more acsessable than it's been in years I am trying to really push it's limits. An excellent test of this is human likenesses. I used my old boss as a test of this because of his shapely hair and recognizable cheek bones. My first attempt I got a pretty awful 3D scan and I didn't want to waste his time any more than I already had so I had to adapt. From this I learned better 3D scanning techniques as well as how to recover a poorly scanned subject. What I had to do was overlay what I'd managed to get over Dwayne Johnsons head and used Blender to make the combination a little more seamless. Happy with the experiance, more happy than the final product for sure.
