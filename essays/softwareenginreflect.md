My Reflection on Software Engineering 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This software engineering class has been one of the most rewarding courses I’ve taken, even though it came with its fair share of challenges. The workload was intense, and I encountered obstacles with tools like PGAdmin and GitHub. Yet, through those struggles, I not only grew more comfortable with complex development environments but also gained invaluable skills that I know will serve me well in the future. The workouts of the day (WODs) were particularly helpful in sharpening my software engineering skills, and the final project, which involved creating a web application, was a highlight of the semester. I found it so enjoyable that I often worked on it while procrastinating other assignments—a testament to how engaging the process was.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many topics covered, **Agile Project Management**, **coding standards**, and **user interface frameworks** stood out as the most impactful for me. Agile Project Management, as I see it, is all about flexibility—being able to adapt to changes and setbacks during development without losing sight of the bigger picture. For example, during my final project, I initially envisioned a dynamic user interface that allowed users to swap product colors and see the changes visually. However, as development progressed, I realized that building a functional product database and cart system was a more practical and impactful goal. This shift in priorities reflects the essence of Agile Project Management: embracing challenges and turning them into opportunities to deliver a product that meets evolving needs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Coding standards** were another key area of growth. While I’ve always struggled to maintain consistent coding standards, this course highlighted their importance, especially when working in a team. At times, inconsistent coding styles among team members created difficulties, but addressing this issue collectively improved our development process. By the end of the semester, I noticed significant improvement in my own coding habits, which will help me write more maintainable and scalable code in the long term. The use of AI also played a role in refining my coding standards, making the process more efficient and reinforcing the value of clean, consistent code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, **user interface frameworks** were an area where I made substantial progress. Before this class, I was hesitant to push myself with user interface design, particularly styling elements, as CSS was a weak spot for me. However, learning tools like React and Next.js made these challenges more manageable. I also learned to leverage AI effectively—not to replace my skills, but to enhance them by generating designs that were beyond my current abilities and then breaking them down to understand how they worked. This approach allowed me to continuously improve without hitting a bottleneck. Through the WODs and the final project, I also developed a better eye for effective design and layout, and I now feel confident in my ability to handle any user interface challenge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this class was an intense but incredibly rewarding experience. It not only deepened my understanding of software engineering concepts but also boosted my confidence in my abilities as a developer. The lessons I’ve learned about project management, coding standards, and user interface design extend far beyond web application development and will undoubtedly shape how I approach future projects. While I know there’s always more to learn, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and excited to continue growing in this field.
